# libpgn
The PGN (Portable Game Notation) parser.

This project is an attempt to learn something new. Since I was always interested in working with the text, I tried to write a parser for PGN files. I was wondering what difficulties might arise during the design and implementation of the parser.
The parser basically follows the specification but has a flexible configuration that allows you to deviate or vice versa to strictly follow the PGN specification.  I had to balance between fine writing code and performance.
